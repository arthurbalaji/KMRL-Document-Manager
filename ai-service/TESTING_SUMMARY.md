**Current Status (as of last test):**
```json
{
    "deepseek_api": {
        "status": "healthy",
        "usage_stats": {
            "cache_entries": 1,
            "rate_limit_remaining": 50,
            "requests_last_minute": 0,
            "total_requests": 1
        }
    },
    "system_status": "optimal"
}
```

## 🔧 Maintenance Recommendations

### Daily Monitoring
- Check `/api-status` endpoint for system health
- Monitor cache hit rates and API usage patterns
- Review error logs for any new issues

### Weekly Review
- Analyze API usage patterns for optimization opportunities
- Review cache performance and adjust TTL if needed
- Check for any new DeepSeek API features to incorporate

### Monthly Optimization
- Review rate limiting settings based on usage patterns
- Optimize cache size based on memory usage
- Update DeepSeek API integration if new models available
