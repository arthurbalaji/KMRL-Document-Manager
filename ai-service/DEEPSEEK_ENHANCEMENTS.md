- Graceful degradation of functionality
- Comprehensive error logging

### 9. API Status Monitoring
**New Endpoint:** `/api-status` for system health monitoring

**Information Provided:**
- DeepSeek API connectivity status
- Usage statistics and rate limit status
- Local fallback system availability
- Enhancement feature status
- Performance metrics

## Implementation Details

### New Dependencies
No new external dependencies required - all enhancements use existing libraries.

### Configuration Options
```python
# API Optimizer Settings
max_requests_per_minute = 50  # Adjustable based on API limits
cache_ttl = 3600  # Cache time-to-live in seconds
max_cache_entries = 1000  # Maximum cache size
```

### Error Handling Strategy
Each enhanced function includes:
1. Try DeepSeek API enhancement
2. Catch specific API errors (quota, timeout, authentication)
3. Fall back to existing local methods
4. Log errors for debugging
5. Return result with confidence indicators

## Performance Improvements

### API Call Reduction
